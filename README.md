# LoadTime.js
This simple script creates a new element at the top left of the page. This element has a number in it which tells you how long it took for that page to load.

The script has no dependencies so it works without the need to include any other JS frameworks.

This is a modified version of the script which is on page 133 of The Smashing Book #4.
